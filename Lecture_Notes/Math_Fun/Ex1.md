### Task 1

The operation $\bigstar$ adds two numbers and then divides the result of the addition by 3. For example:  
$6 \bigstar 9 = (6 + 9) : 3 = 5$ (see Graph 1).  

What number is in the gray field of Graph 2?


**Graph 1:**

```mermaid

    A[6] --> C
    B[9] --> C
    C[5]
```

**Graph 2:**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[1]
    B[2]
    C[?]
    D[?]
    E[2]
    A-->C
    B-->C
    C-->E
    D-->E
```

The task is to finish the Graph 2.

### Task 2

Prove that $a \bigstar b = b \bigstar a$.
